# Battleship Game Build in Python

## Portfolio Project 3 - Python Essentials

The objective of the third project was to construct an interactive, logical game that facilitates user engagement in a competitive setting with a computer-based opponent.

# Link to app
The app can be found <a href="https://pp3-battleship-game.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).

# How to Play 
1.Run the code in a Python environment.
2.Enter your name when prompted.
3.For each turn, enter a row and column guess.
4.If your guess matches the location of the battleship, you win the game.
5.If you use up all 5 turns without guessing the correct location, you lose the game.
6.You will be prompted to play again or quit.

# Code Structure 
The game is implemented in Python and contains the following components:

1.A game board represented by a 2D array.
2.A function for randomly placing the battleship on the board.
3.A function for printing the game board.
4.A loop that allows the player to make 5 guesses.
5.Conditional statements for handling different guess outcomes.
6.A prompt for playing again or quitting.

# Technologies Used:
### Programming Languages:
* Python
### Git
* Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
### Github
* GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
