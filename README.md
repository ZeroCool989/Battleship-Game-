# Battleship Game Build in Python

## Portfolio Project 3 - Python Essentials

The objective of the third project was to construct an interactive, logical game that facilitates user engagement in a competitive setting with a computer-based opponent.

# Link to app
The app can be found <a href="https://pp3-battleship-game.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).

# How to Play 
1.Run the code in a Python environment.
2.Enter your name when prompted.
3.For each turn, enter a row and column guess.
4.If your guess matches the location of the battleship, you win the game.
5.If you use up all 5 turns without guessing the correct location, you lose the game.
6.You will be prompted to play again or quit.

# Code Structure 
The game is implemented in Python and contains the following components:

1.A game board represented by a 2D array.
2.A function for randomly placing the battleship on the board.
3.A function for printing the game board.
4.A loop that allows the player to make 5 guesses.
5.Conditional statements for handling different guess outcomes.
6.A prompt for playing again or quitting.

# Technologies Used:
### Programming Languages:
* Python
### Git
* Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
### Github
* GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

# Testing
## Functionality testing
* Each piece of code was tested in Gitpod.
* I also tested the app once the final product was deployed.
## Code Validation
* The code was checked using CI Python Linter online checker.

# Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps, I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the Repository, click on the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" and click on save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. The now published site link shows at the top of the page.

The project was then deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

1. Log in to Heroku and add a new app.
2. Link the project from GitHub to Heroku.
4. Add the Python and NodeJS buildpacks.
5. Manually deploy the project (I used the manual deploy option in order to control what version was deployed to the live environment).

# Credits
* The code for the structure of the game board was adapted from the below example (right click to open in new tab).
